    2. **Important**: The function that drives one of the challenges is `updateCurrentPage(str)` which takes 1 parameter, a string of the word to display as the current page. This function is not included in the code of the page, along with a few other things, are linked via an external js file. Make sure you do not delete this line.  
5. Create a branch called M3-Challenge-HW if you haven't yet
6. Add this template to that branch (git add/git commit)
7. Make a pull request for this branch once you push it
8. You may manually deploy the HW branch to dev to get the evidence for the below prompts
9. Create a new file **m3_submission.md** file in the hw branch and fill it with the output generated from this page (be careful not to paste more than once)
10. Add, commit, and push the submission file

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Briefly explain how you made the navigation horizontal</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>I used CSS flexbox to make the menu horizontal. The nav element is<br>now a flex container due to the display: flex; property that I put<br>into it. Because of this, I can modify how the items inside the<br>container are laid out using a group of properties known as the flexbox<br>properties. Then I gave the ul element inside the nav the display: flex;<br>property. As a result, the ul element also qualifies as a flex container.<br>Since the navigation items (li elements) are contained within the ul element, these<br>items will be flex items inside the ul container. I changed the flex-direction<br>property of the ul container to row so that the navigation elements would<br>appear horizontally.&nbsp;By doing this, the navigation items are centered and the contents of<br>the nav container are aligned along the horizontal axis.</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Briefly explain how you remove the navigation list item markers</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The content property of the targeted ul element inside the nav container is<br>set to none. By doing this, the standard marker that appears before each<br>list item in an unordered list is removed. By setting content: none, we<br>can get rid of the default marker without changing how the list elements<br>are organized or positioned. This is helpful if you want to customize your<br>navigation menu specifically and don&#39;t want the built-in markers to mess with your<br>layout or style.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> Briefly explain how you gave the navigation a background</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The background-color property in CSS is used to create a background for the<br>navigation. The background-color attribute in the CSS code is set to lightblue, causing<br>the &lt;nav&gt; element&#39;s background to be that color. Targeting the &lt;nav&gt; element in<br>the HTML document using the selector nav. The CSS declaration block in curly<br>brackets provides the style guidelines that should be applied to the element. The<br>background-color property is defined within this declaration block, followed by the value lightblue.<br>This changes the navigation&#39;s background color to light blue.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> Briefly explain how you made the links (or their surrounding area) change color on mouseover/hover</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>When a user hovers their mouse cursor over the links, this code instructs<br>the links&#39; color property to turn red. The:hover pseudo-class is active and the<br>style guidelines specified in the CSS code are applied when the user hovers<br>over a link inside the nav&gt; element. As a result, the link&#39;s text<br>turns red, signaling to the user that the link is being hovered over.<br>You can quickly add hover effects to links and other components on your<br>website to make it more interactive and engaging for your viewers by utilizing<br>the:hover pseudo-class.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 5: </em> Briefly explain how you changed the challenge list bullet points to checkmarks (âœ“)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>This code inserts the checkmark sign&nbsp; as the content of the::before pseudo-element for<br>each list item () in an unordered list (). The checkmark and the<br>list item text are separated slightly by using the margin-right attribute. The bullet<br>points are essentially replaced with checkmarks when the browser sees this CSS code<br>because it applies the style rules to the list items in the HTML<br>code that contains an unordered list. You can alter how unordered lists appear<br>on your website and add aesthetic interest by utilizing the::before pseudo-element. One approach<br>to do this is to use checkmarks in place of the bullet points,<br>which will make your lists stand out and be more visually appealing.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 6: </em> Briefly explain how you made the first character of the h1 tags and anchor tags uppercased</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The text-transform attribute is applied to both the &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;a&gt; elements in<br>the HTML code using this code. The browser will apply the style rules<br>defined in the CSS to the text in these elements when reading this<br>CSS code along with the accompanying HTML code that includes the &lt;h1&gt; and<br>&lt;a&gt; tags, resulting in the first character of each word being capitalized. This<br>method of changing the capitalization of text within particular HTML tags using the<br>text-transform property can help you maintain a consistent look across your entire website.<br>In this instance, it offers a straightforward method for converting the first character<br>of the text in the h1&gt; and a&gt; tags uppercase, which improves both<br>readability and visual appeal.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 7: </em> Briefly explain/describe your custom styling of your choice</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>provides a quick and easy way to specify the standard styling for a<br>webpage&#39;s body, unordered lists, and list items. In order to build an aesthetically<br>pleasing and readable style for the homepage, it establishes several fundamental styling properties<br>like font, color, and spacing.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 8: </em> Briefly explain how the styling for the challenge list doesn't impact the navigation list</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The selectors used to decorate the challenge list and navigation list in the<br>provided CSS code are different. The ul and li selectors are used to<br>style the challenge list, while the nav and a selectors are used to<br>style the navigation bar. The styling guidelines used for one list have no<br>effect on the other list because these selectors are exclusive to each list.<br>For instance, the challenge list is unaffected by the background color and box<br>shadow that are applied to the nav selection; just the navigation bar is.<br>One of the guiding principles of CSS is that each selector only has<br>an impact on the components that match it; it has no bearing on<br>other elements. Complex structures can be made by using distinct selectors for each<br>element or set of elements.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 9: </em> Briefly explain how you updated the content of the h1 tag with the link text</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I updated the content of h1 by An event parameter used in the<br>definition of the function handleClick to represent the click event that initiated the<br>function. The default behavior of the click event, following the link and browsing<br>to the related website, is prevented by the first line of the code,<br>event.preventDefault().The clicked link element is retrieved and assigned to a link variable in<br>the second line, const link = event.target;. The link parameter invokes the function<br>getCurrentSelection, presumably collecting the text or other details related to the clicked link.<br>Due to the set timeout call&#39;s latency of 100 milliseconds, the getCurrentSelection function<br>seems to be asynchronous. Maybe the purpose of this wait is to ensure<br>that the updateCurrentPage method comes after the getCurrentSelection function has finished.is known as.<br>The output of the getCurrentSelection method is passed as a parameter when using<br>the updateCurrentPage process. It is unclear what this method does from the code<br>provided, although it probably modifies a part of the current page based on<br>the user&#39;s click selection.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 10: </em> Briefly explain how you updated the content of the title tag with the link text</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>it is most likely in charge of managing the click event and carrying<br>out some action, such as changing the page&#39;s content in accordance with the<br>link that was clicked. Overall, the user can use links in this code<br>to travel to various parts of the page and create a straightforward navigation<br>menu. Users can more easily access the content they&#39;re seeking for and have<br>a better overall experience on the site when links include clear and descriptive<br>wording.<br></p><br></td></tr>
